    <h4>Supporter's Bar</h4>
    <p>
      Often in the Timbers' and MLS communities, someone (myself included) is
      looking for a place to watch the game away from home, with other fans. There
      are a few scattered data sets out there, Supporter's Bar is intended to be
      a one stop shop for finding a great place to watch the game.

      Supporter's Bar was my first interaction using MapBox, Leaflet.js, and PostgreSQLs PostGIS.
      The combination of these tools allowed me to rapidly develop a system,
      that given the proper data could become the "Yelp" of finding a sports bar.

    <h4>Maptribution</h4>
    <p>
      Maptribution is a simple app that allows users to plot locations on a map. The
      intention is that it could easily be used for small businesses to embed on their site,
      so that their customers have a "Where to find our product" widget. Maptribution
      was built with a real-time updating map, usng Ruby on Rails, MapBox, and React.
      It also handles billing and authentication through the Shopify API
